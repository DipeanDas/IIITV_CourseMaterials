# 📚 IIIT Vadodara Course Repository 

## Dear Juniors,  

This repository is my humble attempt to ease up your academic journey in IIITV. It contains resources from the very first semester to the seventh – **exam questions, course materials, assignments, lab reports, and more.** This repository is a combined result of the efforts from students of Batch 20, 21, 22 and 23 and is getting updated with newer resources being added everyday.

Use this repository as a way to excel in your studies but one request to all to not copy-paste contents from the reports shared here. If you think you are benefitted from this course then don’t hesitate to help your juniors – because that’s how we all grow stronger together. 💪  

Lastly, never forget, **your seniors are rooting for you!** 💖 Let’s keep the spirit of IIIT Vadodara alive and thriving!  

With lots of hope and best wishes,  
**Dipean Dasgupta** <br>
**Batch 2021**
