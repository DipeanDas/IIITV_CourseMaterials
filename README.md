# ðŸ“š IIIT Vadodara Course Repository 

## Dear Juniors,  

Welcome to a treasure trove of knowledge and guidance crafted just for you! ðŸŽ“  

This repository is my humble attempt to ease up your academic journey in IIITV. It contains resources from the very first semester to the seventh â€“ **exam questions, course materials, assignments, lab reports, and more.** Think of it as a legacy passed on from a senior whoâ€™s walked this road and deeply cares about your growth and success. This repository is a combined result of the efforts from students of Batch 20, 21, 22 and 23 and is getting updated with newer resources being added everyday. 

Use this repository as a way to excel in your studies but one request to all to not copy-paste contents from the reports shared here. If you think you are benefitted from this course then donâ€™t hesitate to help your juniors â€“ because thatâ€™s how we all grow stronger together. ðŸ’ª  

Lastly, never forget, **your seniors are rooting for you!** ðŸ’– Letâ€™s keep the spirit of IIIT Vadodara alive and thriving!  

With lots of hope and best wishes,  
**Dipean Dasgupta** <br>
**Batch 2021**
